The numbers from 1 to 2020 (inclusive). That's 2020 numbers.\n2. The squares of the numbers from 1 to 2020 (inclusive). That's another 2020 numbers.\n\nSo, the full list is:\n1, 2, 3, ..., 2020, 1\u00b2, 2\u00b2, 3\u00b2, ..., 2020\u00b2\n\nTotal numbers = 2020 + 2020 = **4040**\n\n**Step 2: Finding the Median Position**\n\nSince there are 4040 numbers (an even number), the median is the average of the 2020th and 2021st smallest numbers in the list.\n\n**Step 3: Sorting the List**\n\nThe numbers 1, 2, ..., 2020 are all less than or equal to 2020.\n\nThe squares 1\u00b2, 2\u00b2, ..., 2020\u00b2 are:\n- 1\u00b2 = 1\n- 2\u00b2 = 4\n- ...\n- 44\u00b2 = 1936\n- 45\u00b2 = 2025\n- ...\n- 2020\u00b2 = a very large number\n\nNotice that for n \u2265 45, n\u00b2 \u2265 2025, which is greater than 2020.\n\nSo, among the squares, only 1\u00b2 to 44\u00b2 (i.e., 1 to 1936) are less than or equal to 2020. The rest (from 45\u00b2 = 2025 upwards) are greater than 2020.\n\n**Step 4: Counting Numbers \u2264 2020**\n\n- The numbers 1 to 2020: **2020 numbers**\n- The squares 1\u00b2 to 44\u00b2: **44 numbers** (since 44\u00b2 = 1936 < 2020, but 45\u00b2 = 2025 > 2020)\n\nHowever, some numbers might be counted twice if a square is also in 1 to 2020. For example, 1 is both in the first part and as 1\u00b2 in the second part.\n\nThe squares from 1\u00b2 to 44\u00b2 are all in the range 1 to 2020, so each of these numbers appears **twice** in the list: once as n and once as n\u00b2.\n\nSo, the numbers less than or equal to 2020 in the list are:\n- All numbers from 1 to 2020 (2020 numbers)\n- Plus an extra copy of each perfect square from 1\u00b2 to 44\u00b2 (since these are already included in 1 to 2020, but appear again as squares), so **44 extra numbers**.\n\nTotal numbers \u2264 2020 in the list: **2020 + 44 = 2064**\n\n**Step 5: Locating the Median**\n\nWe need the 2020th and 2021st smallest numbers.\n\nSince there are 2064 numbers \u2264 2020, both the 2020th and 2021st smallest numbers are \u2264 2020.\n\n**Step 6: What are the 2020th and 2021st Smallest Numbers?**\n\n- The numbers from 1 to 2020, plus an extra copy of each perfect square from 1\u00b2 to 44\u00b2.\n- The first 44 numbers that appear twice are the perfect squares: 1, 4, 9, ..., 1936.\n\nSo, the sorted list up to 2020 looks like:\n1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, ..., 1936, 1936, 1937, ..., 2020\n\nIf we count:\n- For each perfect square k\u00b2 (where k = 1 to 44), it appears **twice**.\n- For each non-square number between 1 and 2020, it appears **once**.\n\nLet's count how many numbers are less than or equal to 2020 in the sorted list:\n\n- Number of distinct numbers from 1 to 2020: 2020\n- Number of perfect squares between 1 and 2020: 44 (since 44\u00b2 = 1936 < 2020, 45\u00b2 = 2025 > 2020)\n- Each perfect square appears twice, so 44 extra numbers.\n\nSo, total numbers \u2264 2020: 2020 + 44 = 2064\n\nNow, let's find the 2020th and 2021st smallest numbers.\n\n- The first 44 numbers that appear twice are the perfect squares.\n- So, up to 2020, the count is:\n  - For numbers 1 to 2020:\n    - If the number is a perfect square, it appears twice.\n    - If not, it appears once.\n\nSo, to find the 2020th and 2021st smallest numbers, let's see how many numbers are less than or equal to 2020.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- S = set of perfect squares from 1 to 2020 (i.e., 1\u00b2, 2\u00b2, ..., 44\u00b2)\n- For each number n from 1 to 2020:\n  - If n \u2208 S, it appears twice.\n  - If n \u2209 S, it appears once.\n\nSo, the total number of numbers up to n in the sorted list is:\n- For n < 1: 0\n- For n \u2265 1: (n - number of perfect squares \u2264 n) + 2 * (number of perfect squares \u2264 n)\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- k = number of perfect squares \u2264 n (i.e., largest integer such that k\u00b2 \u2264 n)\n\nSo, total numbers \u2264 n = n + k\n\nWe want to find n such that total numbers \u2264 n is at least 2020.\n\nLet\u2019s try n = 2020:\n- k = 44 (since 44\u00b2 = 1936 \u2264 2020, 45\u00b2 = 2025 > 2020)\n- total numbers \u2264 2020 = 2020 + 44 = 2064\n\nSo, the 2020th smallest number is 2020 + 44 = 2064th number is 2020.\n\nBut let's check what number is at position 2020.\n\n- For n = 1976:\n  - k = 44 (since 44\u00b2 = 1936 \u2264 1976 < 45\u00b2)\n  - total numbers \u2264 1976 = 1976 + 44 = 2020\n\nSo, the 2020th smallest number is **1976**.\n\nSimilarly, for n = 1977:\n- k = 44\n- total numbers \u2264 1977 = 1977 + 44 = 2021\n\nSo, the 2021st smallest number is **1977**.\n\n**Step 7: The Median**\n\nThe median is the average of the 2020th and 2021st smallest numbers, which are 1976 and 1977.\n\nSo, the median is:\n\n(1976 + 1977) / 2 = 3953 / 2 = **1976.5**\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe median of the list is **1976.5**."}]}
